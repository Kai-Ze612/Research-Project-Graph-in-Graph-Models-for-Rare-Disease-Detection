# True Gene Classification Based on the GiG Framework:
This repository contains the implementation and results of our research project on Graph-in-Graph Models for Rare Disease Detection, conducted in collaboration with two teammates at the Technical University of Munich.

Teammates:
* Kai-Ze Deng
* Büşra Nur Zeybek
* Tuna Karacan

Supervisor:
* Kamilia Zaripova

## Dataset:
The dataset comes from [Harvard Dataverse Shepherd Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TZTPFL)

The preprocessed dataset is too large to be stored in this GitHub repo. It is available via [my personal Onedrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!ApjXPmewijhuvYspZCrEgfe5q0XmjA?e=sbb3TT)
